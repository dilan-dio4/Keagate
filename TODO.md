# TODOs

* Flexible expire timer UI in invoice client
  * Formats like *DD-MM-YY hh:mm a* or *day-of-week hh:mm a* depending on expiration value.
* Inline web payments via JS SDK
  * Small pop-up UI (like Stripe)
* Native api for request throttle values
* Dynamic throttling
  * Keagate public API for base times
    * Blockbook and other providers have changing rate-limits
  * Based on number of active payments(?)
* Invoice client unconfirmed balance view
  * Only needed for certain chains (Dash, LTC, BTC, DOGE)
